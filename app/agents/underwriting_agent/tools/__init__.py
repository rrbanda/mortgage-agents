UnderwritingAgent Tools Package

This package aggregates all specialized tools for the UnderwritingAgent,
ensuring they are properly exposed and validated for mortgage underwriting use.

The UnderwritingAgent focuses on 4 core underwriting capabilities:
1. Credit risk analysis and evaluation
2. Debt-to-income calculations and validation
3. Income source evaluation and qualification
4. Final underwriting decision making

Currently Implemented Tools:
- analyze_credit_risk: Neo4j-powered credit risk assessment and analysis
- calculate_debt_to_income: DTI calculations and validation against program limits
- evaluate_income_sources: Income source analysis and qualification calculations
- make_underwriting_decision: Comprehensive underwriting decision engine

Each tool module contains:
- Tool implementation with @tool decorator
- Pydantic schema for arguments
- Validation function for testing
- Neo4j integration for real underwriting rules
