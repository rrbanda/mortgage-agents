MortgageAdvisorAgent Workflow Tests
====================================

STEP 1 in Mortgage Process: Initial Exploration & Guidance

This agent helps customers:
- Understand different loan programs
- Get personalized loan recommendations
- Check if they meet basic qualification criteria

Test Scenarios (UI-Ready Prompts):
- Exploring loan options as first-time buyer
- Getting credit score requirements
- Comparing FHA vs Conventional loans
- Checking qualification with specific financial profile

All tests use ASYNC execution (ainvoke) for MCP tool compatibility.
