# Mortgage Business Rules MCP Server - Main Specification

## Purpose

Define a standalone MCP server architecture for mortgage business rules processing using GenMCP framework and Neo4j business rules engine.

**Framework**: [GenMCP](https://github.com/genmcp/gen-mcp) - Python-based MCP server generator  
**Rules Engine**: Neo4j graph database  
**Scope**: Business rules evaluation and decision making only  
**Integration**: Standalone server that can be called by any mortgage processing system  

## Problem Statement

Current mortgage processing systems have business rules scattered across multiple codebases, making them difficult to maintain, update, and reuse. We need a centralized, standardized way to evaluate mortgage business rules that can be consumed by any system in the mortgage processing pipeline.

## Solution Overview

A standalone MCP server that:

1. **Centralizes Business Rules**: All mortgage business rules stored in Neo4j graph database
2. **Provides Standardized API**: MCP protocol for consistent integration
3. **Enables Reusability**: Can be called by any mortgage processing system
4. **Supports Real-time Updates**: Rules can be updated without code changes
5. **Ensures Type Safety**: Pydantic schemas for input/output validation

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Business Rules Evaluation**: Evaluate mortgage data against business rules
2. **Multiple Rule Categories**: Support 8 major business rules categories
3. **Structured Input/Output**: Type-safe data exchange using Pydantic schemas
4. **Neo4j Integration**: Query and apply rules from Neo4j database
5. **MCP Protocol**: Expose tools via Model Context Protocol
6. **OpenAPI Compatibility**: Generate OpenAPI specs for REST integration

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Sub-second response times for rule evaluation
2. **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent rule evaluations
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
4. **Maintainability**: Rules stored in database, not code
5. **Security**: Secure access to business rules and data
6. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics

## Business Rules Categories

Based on existing `business_rules/` folder structure:

### 1. Application Processing Rules
- **Application Intake**: Required fields, data validation, completeness checks
- **URLA Form Generation**: Form field mappings and validation rules
- **Data Normalization**: Standardizing data across different sources

### 2. Financial Assessment Rules  
- **Income Calculation**: Complex income calculations with relationship dependencies
- **Debt Analysis**: Analyzing debt patterns and relationships
- **Property Valuation**: Property value assessment using comparable networks

### 3. Risk Scoring Rules
- **Network Risk Analysis**: Fraud detection through relationship patterns
- **Behavioral Scoring**: Scoring based on behavioral networks
- **Market Risk Assessment**: Property and market risk through geographic networks

### 4. Compliance Rules
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Cascading compliance requirements
- **Fair Lending**: Ensuring fair lending through pattern analysis
- **Privacy Regulations**: Data privacy across entity relationships

### 5. Underwriting Rules
- **Automated Underwriting**: Graph-based decision trees
- **Manual Underwriting Rules**: Complex rule dependencies
- **Exception Handling**: Exception patterns and resolutions

### 6. Pricing Rules
- **Rate Calculation**: Pricing based on risk networks and market conditions
- **Fee Structure**: Fee calculations with relationship-based adjustments
- **Market Positioning**: Competitive positioning through market network analysis

### 7. Verification Rules
- **Identity Verification**: Cross-referencing identity across networks
- **Document Verification**: Document authenticity and relationship validation
- **Employment Verification**: Employment history through company networks

### 8. Process Optimization Rules
- **Workflow Optimization**: Optimizing processes based on relationship patterns
- **Performance Analytics**: Analytics across the entire mortgage network
- **Predictive Models**: Predictive modeling using graph algorithms

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
-  **Rule Evaluation Accuracy**: 99.9% accuracy in business rules evaluation
-  **Response Time**: < 500ms average response time for rule evaluation
-  **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling
-  **Integration Success**: Successfully integrated with at least 3 mortgage systems

### Secondary Success Metrics
-  **Developer Experience**: Easy integration with clear documentation
-  **Rule Maintenance**: Rules can be updated without code deployment
-  **Performance**: Handle 1000+ concurrent rule evaluations
-  **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and alerting

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use GenMCP framework for MCP server generation
- Must integrate with existing Neo4j business rules database
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing business rules
- Must support both MCP and REST API protocols

### Assumptions
- Neo4j database is available and properly configured
- Business rules are already loaded into Neo4j
- Clients will provide structured data (no natural language parsing needed)
- Network connectivity between MCP server and Neo4j is reliable

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **GenMCP Framework**: For MCP server generation
- **Neo4j Database**: For business rules storage and querying
- **Python 3.11+**: Runtime environment
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and serialization

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing `business_rules/` folder structure
- Neo4j business rules data model
- Mortgage processing system integration points

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Neo4j Performance**: Complex queries may be slow
   - *Mitigation*: Query optimization and caching strategies
2. **MCP Protocol Limitations**: Protocol may not support all use cases
   - *Mitigation*: Fallback to REST API for complex scenarios
3. **Data Consistency**: Rules may become inconsistent
   - *Mitigation*: Validation and testing frameworks

### Business Risks
1. **Rule Accuracy**: Incorrect rule evaluation
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and validation
2. **Integration Complexity**: Difficult to integrate with existing systems
   - *Mitigation*: Clear documentation and examples
3. **Performance Impact**: Slow rule evaluation
   - *Mitigation*: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Rule Versioning**: Support for rule versioning and rollback
- **A/B Testing**: Support for A/B testing of business rules
- **Machine Learning**: Integration with ML models for rule optimization
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for real-time rule updates

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for multiple server instances
- **Caching**: Redis integration for rule caching
- **Load Balancing**: Support for load balancing across instances
- **Database Sharding**: Neo4j cluster support for large rule sets
