# Credit Check MCP - UI Test Guide ðŸŽ¯

## âœ… Fix Applied: Async MCP Support

**Status:** The workflow is now async-enabled, allowing MCP tools to work in LangGraph Studio UI!

---

## ðŸ§ª How to Test Credit Check MCP from UI

### Test 1: Credit Score Check
**Prompt to use in UI:**
```
Please check the credit score for SSN 123-45-6789 to verify this borrower's creditworthiness.
```

**What to look for:**
- âœ… Tool call appears: `credit_score`
- âœ… Agent returns actual credit score (e.g., "Credit Score: 742")
- âœ… Response mentions "credit score", "bureau", "status"

---

### Test 2: Identity Verification
**Prompt to use in UI:**
```
I need to verify the identity for SSN 987-65-4321, first name Sarah, last name Johnson, DOB 1990-03-20.
```

**What to look for:**
- âœ… Tool call appears: `verify_identity`
- âœ… Agent returns verification status (verified/not verified)
- âœ… Response mentions "identity verified", "confidence", "match details"

---

### Test 3: Full Credit Report
**Prompt to use in UI:**
```
Pull a full credit report for SSN 555-12-3456 for underwriting review.
```

**What to look for:**
- âœ… Tool call appears: `credit_report`
- âœ… Agent returns detailed credit report
- âœ… Response mentions "credit report", "accounts", "payment history"

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Workflow nodes are now async** (`async def agent_execution`)
2. **Agent invocations use `await agent.ainvoke()`** instead of `agent.invoke()`
3. **MCP tools remain async-only** (no sync wrapper needed)

### Why This Works:
- LangGraph Studio UI can now properly execute async MCP tools
- The previous `NotImplementedError('StructuredTool does not support sync invocation')` is resolved
- Neo4j MCP and Credit Check MCP both work seamlessly

## ðŸŽ¨ Expected UI Behavior

When you enter a credit check prompt in the UI, you should see:

1. **Tool Call Panel** showing:
   ```
   credit_score chatcmpl-tool-xxxxx
   {
     "ssn": "123-45-6789"
   }
   ```

2. **Tool Result Panel** showing:
   ```
   Credit Score: 742, Status: Active, Bureau: Mock
   ```

3. **Agent Response** incorporating the data:
   ```
   Based on the credit check, this borrower has a credit score of 742,
   which is in the "very good" range...
   ```
