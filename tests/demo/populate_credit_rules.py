Populate Neo4j with Realistic Credit Score Rules
=================================================

This script adds credit score requirements for different loan programs
based on real-world standards from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

Credit Score Ranges (Industry Standard):
- 300-579: Poor
- 580-669: Fair
- 670-739: Good
- 740-799: Very Good
- 800-850: Exceptional

Loan Program Requirements (Real Industry Standards):
- FHA: 580 minimum (500 with 10% down)
- VA: No minimum (but lenders typically want 620+)
- USDA: No minimum (but lenders typically want 640+)
- Conventional: 620 minimum (better rates at 740+)
- Jumbo: 700+ minimum
